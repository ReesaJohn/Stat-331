## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

```{r}
am1 <- mtcars %>% 
  filter(am==1)%>%
 pull(hp)

am0 <- mtcars %>%
  filter(am==0)%>%
  pull(hp)


am00<-replicate(1000,sample(am0,replace = TRUE),simplify = FALSE)

am11<-replicate(1000,sample(am1,replace = TRUE),simplify = FALSE)

```


```{r}
am00_means <- map_dbl(am00, mean)
am11_means <- map_dbl(am11, mean)
diff = am00_means - am11_means
quantile(diff, c(0.025, .975))
```
