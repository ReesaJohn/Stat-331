**Introduction**


1. Provide a brief overview (2-4 sentences) of the dataset. You may simply reference your work on the
Day 2 activity to make this summary. We are repeating this because it is always good practice to start
an analysis by getting a feel for the data and providing a quick summary for readers.

This dataset is the results of a survey where 168 subjects were asked to define 64 AAE words. Each subject-word pair had a row on the table. The survey also recorded other data such as each subject's sex, age, ethnicity, genres of music they like, etc. Some of the categorical variables were converted into discrete or binary variables such as knowledge of Justin Bieber songs (bieber) and is Jay-z married or not (jayz1).

```{r}
str(hiphop)
```
```{r}
summary(hiphop)
```



2. How many unique AAE words were studied in this dataset?

64 unique words were studied in this dataset, and all are listed below.

```{r}
unique(hiphop[,"word"])
```

3. Make a new variable that recategorizes ethnic into only two groups, “white” and “non-white”, to
simplify your data.

```{r}

newhiphop <- hiphop %>%
                mutate(simpleEthnic = case_when(
                    .$ethnic == "white" ~ "white",
                    TRUE ~ "non-white"
                )
              )
```


4. What are the demographics of the people in this study? Investigate the variables sex, age, and ethnic
and summarize your findings in 1-3 complete sentences.

There are 117 women and 51 men in this study, and their ages range from 16 to 48, with the middle 50% being between 18 to 20 years of age. The most common ethnicity is white, which is well over 75% of the subjects, folowed by Asian, and then African.

```{r}
people <- hiphop %>%
    distinct(subj, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

```{r}
people %>% 
  select(sex,age,ethnic) %>%
  summary()
```

5. Make at least two plots to display the demographic information of the subjects in this study. You
do not need to discuss these plots, but make sure they are appropriate to the data types and have
informative titles and axis labels.

```{r}
people %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex))+geom_bar()+xlab("Sex")+ylab("Survey Respondents")+ggtitle("Sex of Survey Respondents")

people %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=age))+geom_boxplot()+xlab("Survey Respondents")+ylab("Age")+ggtitle("Age of Survey Respondents")
people %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ethnic))+geom_bar()+xlab("Ethnicity")+ylab("Survey Respondents")+ggtitle("Ethnicity of Survey Respondents")
```

**Familiar Words**

1. For each demographic group listed below, determine which word(s) in this study was the most and
least familiar on average.

a. People below the age of 20

For people below 20 the most familiar word was "off the hook" and the least familiar word was "catch the vapors."

```{r}
below20 <- hiphop %>%
  filter(age<20)%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(avgFamiliarity=mean(familiarity))

below20%>%top_n(1,avgFamiliarity)
below20%>%top_n(-1,avgFamiliarity)

```

b. Non-white women

For non-white women, the most familiar word was "feel me" and the least familiar word was "The Nation."

```{r}
noWhiteWoman <- newhiphop %>%
  filter(simpleEthnic == "non-white")%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(avgFamiliarity=mean(familiarity))

noWhiteWoman%>%top_n(1,avgFamiliarity)
noWhiteWoman%>%top_n(-1,avgFamiliarity)
```


c. White men above the age of 30

For white men above age 30, there are 3 words tied for most familiar "5-0", "feel me", and "off the hook."

There are 15 words tied for least familiar among white men over age 30, which are displayed on the table below, all with an average familiarity of 1.

```{r}
whitemen30 <- hiphop %>%
  filter(age>20 & sex == "Male" & ethnic=="white")%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(avgFamiliarity=mean(familiarity))

whitemen30%>%top_n(1,avgFamiliarity)
whitemen30%>%top_n(-1,avgFamiliarity)
```


**Use the data**

A former Canadian child TV star named Aubrey Graham is interested in switching careers to become a
rapper. Aubrey hires you to consult the hiphop dataset to help compose his new songs.
Note: There is no single right answer to these questions. You will need to think about how you want to address
the question, and do the appropriate variable adjustments and calculations to come up with a reasonable
answer.

1. Aubrey hopes that his songs will be percieved as authentically hiphop. He hopes his lyrics will be
recognizeable to those who describe themselves as hiphop fans, but less recognizeable to those who do
not consider themselves fans. Suggest some words or phrases that Aubrey should try to use, and some
words he should avoid.

The phrases "hella", "what it do", "boo", "finna", and "make it rain" are phrases that will be fairly recognizable to hip hop fans (who I have classified as those that like more than 2 hip hop artists), but not to those who are not (who I have classified as those that like 0 hip hop artists). I have created this list by first filtering out words that the people who aren't hiphop fans generally recognize (average familiarity > 3.5) and then taking the top 5 words/phrases that have the greatest familiarity among those that listen to hiphop.
```{r}
 likeHiphop <- hiphop %>% 
    filter(hiphop>2)%>%
    group_by(word)%>%
    summarize(avgHipFam=mean(familiarity))

  notHiphop <- hiphop %>%
    filter(hiphop==0)%>%
    group_by(word)%>%
    summarize(avgNoHipFam=mean(familiarity))
  
combined <- full_join(likeHiphop,notHiphop)

combined%>%arrange(desc(avgHipFam))%>%
  filter(avgNoHipFam<3.5)%>%top_n(5,avgHipFam)
```
2. Although Aubrey wants to be authentic, he also hopes to sell records, of course. Two titles have been
suggested for his first album: “Hotline Boo” or “Hella Bling”. Based on the dataset, which will appeal
more to the higher population areas? Make at least one plot to support your answer.

I considered a person to be from a higher population area if either their city's population was greater than 100000 (slightly less than the 3rd quartile for city population), or their county's population was greater than 900000 ( about 59000 less than the the 3rd quartile for county population, but still fairly close to the the 3rd quartile). Then I only looked at the average familiarity for the words "boo" and "hella" and found "hella" to be the one with the greater average familiarity, which indicates more people would recognize and probably buy the album "Hella Bling". So "Hella Bling" is the better option.



```{r}

betterAlbum <- hiphop %>%
  filter((city>100000|county>900000)&(word=="hella"|word=="boo"))%>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(avgFamiliarity=mean(familiarity))

betterAlbum%>%ggplot(aes(x=word, y=avgFamiliarity))+geom_col()+xlab("Word")+ylab("Average Familiarity")+ggtitle("Average Familiarity Between Hella and Boo")

```


3. Aubrey’s true life dream is to collaborate with his fellow Canadian musician Justin Bieber. Luckily, he
knows that Bieber himself was one of the subjects in this study! You know that Bieber is a white male,
aged 17-23 at the time of the study, from a relatively small town (10,000-60,000 people) in Ontario.
Determine which subject is secretly Bieber, and justify your answer.
Then suggest a track listing (11 song titles) for Aubrey’s album collaboration with the Biebs.

There were no men that knew 5 Justin Bieber songs in this survey, but I figured Justin Bieber should at least know 4 of his songs, so I filtered for a 17-23 year old white male who is from a small city and knows 4 Justin Bieber songs (bieber==5) and looked for his top 11 most familiar words.

Seeing as how these are words are the AAE words the subject I presume to be Bieber is most familar with, I suggest the following track record:

1. **A-town**
2. My **Boo**
3. **Chedda** Baby
4. Falling **Duckets**
5. **Feel Me**
6. **Hard** 
7. **Hella** Lit
8. **Off the Hook**
9. **Player Hater**
10. **Toe Up **
11. **What It Is?**

```{r}


JustinBieber <- hiphop %>%
  mutate( city = case_when(
                   city<=60000 ~ "small",
                   city>60000 & city<=100000 ~ "medium",
                   city>100000 ~ "large")  
                          )%>%
  filter(bieber==5&sex=="Male"&ethnic=="white"&age>=17&age<=23&city=="small") %>%
  top_n(11,familiarity)%>%
  arrange(desc(familiarity))%>%
  select(word,familiarity)

JustinBieber
```
